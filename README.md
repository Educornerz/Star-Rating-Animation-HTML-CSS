# Star-Rating-Animation-HTML-CSS
The five-star rating HTML CSS is basically what we see in a review section. This type of review rating system is used for different types of business, product, and e-commerce websites. With the help of this 5-star rating, the user will be able to give reviews about that product. 
The 5 Star Rating created here has been created using only HTML and CSS. There are five stars and hover effects added to them. When you click on those stars, the background color of the stars will be yellow.
